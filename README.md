Standard Library for the Bzo programming language. Still a work in progress.

Because the main compiler (https://github.com/charlesrosenbauer/Bzo-Compiler) is not currently outputting working programs, most of this code is mostly here for testing purposes. Very little of it actually reflects plans for the language aside from in broad strokes, and aside from the syntax used.

Licensed under MIT because if it were under GPL, GPL would infect every program that uses the standard library. Bzo is designed so that the standard library *is replaceable* so technically it would be possible to get around that, but this just makes things easier.

Of course none of that matters a whole lot yet anyway because the compiler doesn't actually produce programs yet. Oh well.
